# **OpenIPSL**: Open-Instance Power System Library:
The OpenIPSL or Open-Instance Power System Library is library of power system component models written in the [Modelica](http://modelica.org) language that can be used for power system dynamic analysis, such as phasor time-domain simulations.

OpenIPSL is currently developed and maintained by Prof. [Luigi Vanfretti's](https://github.com/lvanfretti) research group [ALSETLab](https://github.com/ALSETLab) at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://rpi.edu), Troy, NY, collaborators and friends, such as [Dietmar Winkler](https://github.com/dietmarw) and [FOSSEE](https://om.fossee.in/fellowship2018) (contributions are welcome!).

## Scope
The purposes of OpenIPSL are to be used for research and education (therefore frequent release times may be available), with maximum compatibility with [OpenModelica](http://openmodelica.org/) (to provide a free/libre and cost-free alternative for power system dynamic simulation), to provide as many as possible typical "test networks" for use in research and teaching, and to be developed in such way that the library can efficiently be used for power system simulation within Modelica-based workflows (i.e., helping to give reference power system models for development and testing of Modelica back-end compilers) when faced with power system simulation challenges.

Please note that the library contains only models that can be used for the study. As such, there are no solver tools provided in this repository (no Power Flow Solvers, no Time-Domain solvers, etc.).
The user should use a Modelica-compliant tool for simulation of models in this lirbary.

## History
The iPSL is a [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org) library developed during the [iTesla project](http://www.itesla-project.eu/).
The members of this project (OpenIPSL) at SmarTS Lab (now [ALSETLab](https://github.com/ALSETLab)) where key developers of the iPSL until March 31, 2016, when the iTesla project was completed.
Prof. [Luigi Vanfretti](https://github.com/lvanfretti) lead the development of a large amount of the models of the library (particularly those that replicate results from PSAT and PSS/E).
iPSL is part of the [iTesla Tool](https://github.com/itesla/ipst), and thus, it is subject to the needs of the consortium that develops the iTesla Tool.
Therefore, the SmarTS Lab / ALSETLab team decided to create the OpenIPSL fork in order to develop the library in a direction that is more suitable for researchers and teachers/professors, and in a transparent, open source software approach.

## Documentation:
Documentation is provided within the library and can be accessed when loading OpenIPSL in any Modelica-compliant tool. Additional documentation can also be found [**here**](http://openipsl.readthedocs.io/).

Tutorials on OpenIPSL have been given at many conferences, and are available under [Release](https://github.com/SmarTS-Lab/OpenIPSL/releases).
We recommend you start from there.

Our documentation assumes that you have working knowledge of the Modelica language, are familiar with a Modelica-compliant modeling and simulation environment, that you have proeficient knowledge on power system steady state analysis (i.e., the so called "power flow"), and knowledge on power system dynamic modeling (i.e., the called "transient" and "small-signal" stability). As such, the documentation is limited, and aims to provide very consice information for people who fulfill the requirements above. If you do not fulfill these requirements, we recommend that you first get acquainted with both Modelica and Power Systems.


## Contributing:
Contributions to the library are welcome and can be submitted in the form of pull requests to this repository.
